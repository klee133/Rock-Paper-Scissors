# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my submission for the Rock Paper Scissors game in the Odin Project.

In the [first part of the project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors), I made a very simple console version of Rock Paper Scissors. By coding this I was able to:
- Practice basic Javascript coding
- Practice using functions
- Practice turning logic into code

In the [second part of the project] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors), I added UI to this game to turn this into a webpage version of Rock Paper Scissors. By doing coding this I was able to:
- Practice the use of element classes
- Practice DOM manipulation
- Learn how to use event listeners

And while this was a simple game to recreate, it helped me improve my understanding of Javascript and HTML and helped me practice what I had learned in the Odin Project.
